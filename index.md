<p>
  I'm a PhD student in Philosophy at <a href="https://philosophy.fsu.edu/person/minsu-kim">Florida State University</a>. Before coming here, I studied Philosophy at Kyung Hee University in South Korea, where I earned both my BA and MA.

  My philosophical interests center on the intersection of (im)morality and (ir)rationality at both individual and collective levels. Iâ€™m especially drawn to topics in action theory, moral psychology, and philosophy of religion.
