<p>
  I'm a first-year PhD student in philosophy at <a href="https://philosophy.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a>. Before coming here, I studied philosophy at Kyung Hee University in South Korea, where I earned both my BA and MA.

<p>
  My interests lie at the intersection of (im)morality and (ir)rationality. I'm especially drawn to topics in action theory, moral psychology, and philosophy of religion.
