<p>
  I'm a second-year PhD student in philosophy at <a href="https://philosophy.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a>. Before coming here, I studied philosophy at Kyunghee University in South Korea, where I earned both my BA and MA.

  My research focuses on what is not up to us, what we take as our own, what brings us together, and what keeps us apart. I am especially drawn to topics in action theory, moral psychology, social epistemology, and philosophy of religion.
