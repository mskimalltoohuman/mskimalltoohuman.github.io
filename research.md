My research explores the actions, emotions, and attitudes of individual, plural, and collective agents in terms of practical and moral reasoning.

At the individual and plural levels, I focus on the intersection of what is not up to us and what we take as our own.
 In action theory, I am interested in the action of deciding, questions of luck, ambivalence, and weakness of will.
 In moral psychology, I am interested in themes of love, loneliness, and the absurd.

At the collective level, my interest centers on the internal barriers and external challenges to living together, in the realm of social epistemology and philosophy of religion.
- My dissertation addresses epistemological crises—such as echo chambers, fake news, and conspiracy theories. It mainly aims to capture agential factors of these phenomena that are not addressed by social-epistemic structural explanations.

- Structure of the dissertation:
  1. A challenge to the predominant social-structural explanations for epistemological crises.
  2. A critical examination of the concepts of epistemic hinge, moral encroachment, and religious belief.
  3. A proposal for a novel agent-based account of epistemological crises.

As opportunities allow, I broaden my research scope by studying cognitive science and philosophy of science. At the same time, I maintain my long-standing interest in ethics by staying current with its themes.

I also have philosophical interests in issues specific to Korean society. Here are some topics I intend to work on in the near or far future.
- about the secular partisanship of the nominal and dogmatic K-Christians
- about the burden and fatigue of some(썸) relationships ('some': a romantic yet ambiguous stage prior to becoming partners)
- about responsibility and accountability in cases of disaster(참사)
- about the meaning of 'jiral(지랄)' (IMO, a kind of bullshit involving certain evaluative judgments)
- about moral attitudinal barriers to living together between disabled and non-disabled people
- about the 2024 Korean medical strike as a form of collective bargaining
- about structural injustice toward the disabled, the illegal protests of Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination (전장연), and disability-related political correctness
- about the phenomenon of *hikikomori* and social withdrawal among Korean youth
- about the ethics of celebrity, particularly concerning *de dicto* moral motivation and the asymmetry of morality
- about an anarchist approach to political obligation regarding mandatory military service
