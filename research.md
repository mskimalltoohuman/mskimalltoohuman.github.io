My philosophical interests center on the intersection of (im)morality and (ir)rationality at both individual and collective levels, with a focus on topics in action theory, moral psychology, and philosophy of religion.

My tentative dissertation concerns a non-factualistic approach to epistemological crises, such as fake news, echo chambers, and conspiracy theories. While epistemological crises are mostly explored with regard to factual beliefs, I aim to challenge the idea that such crises can be exhaustively or primarily explained in terms of how agents respond to those beliefs. Rather, I seek to examine what roles religious beliefs or moral reasons may play in the collective agency of these phenomena, and whether they are central, even indispensable, to a proper understanding of them.

I also have philosophical interests in issues specific to Korean society. Here are some topics I intend to work on in the near or far future.
- about the secular partisanship of the nominal and dogmatic K-Christians
- about the burden and fatigue of some(썸) relationships (‘some’: a romantic yet ambiguous stage prior to becoming partners)
- about responsibility and accountability in cases of disaster(참사)
- about the meaning of 'jiral(지랄)' (IMO, a kind of bullshit involving certain evaluative judgments)
- about moral attitudinal barriers to living together between disabled and non-disabled people
